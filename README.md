# PriceTrack

Very simple pair of scripts I created to help me keep track of Pixel 5 prices on the google store. Originally I created this for tracking M.2 prices, but decided to update it and upload on to Github for the Pixel update.

First file is m2.py which extracts the price from the site using beautiful soup and save it in a text file, and the second scipt "pricer.py" plots the values into a matplotlib graph
